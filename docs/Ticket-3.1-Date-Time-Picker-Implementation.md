# Ticket 3.1: Date and Time Picker Implementation

**Version:** 3.1
**Feature:** Date and Time Picker Integration
**Date:** May 7, 2025

## Overview

This documentation covers the implementation of date and time pickers in the new-scheduler page, as well as the synchronization of the date filter with the PDF preview panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. MeetingFormModal Component

- Replaced the basic text inputs for date and time with modern, user-friendly pickers
- Implemented a calendar-based date picker using `react-day-picker`
- Created a time picker with predefined 30-minute intervals
- Added proper validation and handling of date/time formats

### 2. MeetingManagerPanel Component

- Updated the date filter to use the same calendar picker component
- Added state management for the calendar popover
- Improved the UI with better visual feedback for the selected date

### 3. State Management and Data Flow

- Lifted state up to the parent `MeetingSchedulerLayout` component
- Implemented bidirectional data flow between components
- Added filtering logic to show meetings based on selected date
- Connected the filter date with the PDF preview panel

### 4. View State Controls

- Implemented functional view state toggle buttons in the PDF Preview panel
- Added visual indicators for the active view state
- Ensured smooth transitions between different view states

### 5. Styling

- Added custom CSS for react-day-picker to match the application's design
- Ensured consistent styling across all date and time pickers
- Made sure the components are visually appealing and intuitive

## Technical Details

### Date Formatting

- Used `date-fns` for consistent date parsing and formatting
- Display format: "MMMM d, yyyy" (e.g., "May 7, 2025")
- Input format: "MM/dd/yyyy" (e.g., "05/07/2025")

### Time Options

- Generated time options in 30-minute intervals covering the full 24-hour period
- Formatted as "h:mm AM/PM" (e.g., "10:30 AM", "2:00 PM")

### Component Hierarchy

```
MeetingSchedulerLayout
├── MeetingManagerPanel
│   └── MeetingFormModal
│       ├── DatePicker (using react-day-picker)
│       └── TimePicker (custom dropdown)
└── PDFPreviewPanel
```

### State Flow

- `filterDate` state is managed in MeetingSchedulerLayout
- When a user selects a date in MeetingManagerPanel, it updates the parent state
- The parent component filters meetings based on the selected date
- Filtered meetings are passed to both MeetingManagerPanel and PDFPreviewPanel

## UI/UX Improvements

- Removed the possibility of format errors with structured pickers
- Added visual feedback for selected dates and times
- Improved accessibility with proper labeling and focus states
- Enhanced the overall user experience with intuitive controls

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Navigate to the /schedules/new-scheduler page
2. Try filtering meetings by selecting different dates
3. Verify that both the meeting list and PDF preview update accordingly
4. Test adding a new meeting with the date/time pickers
5. Check that view state controls properly change the layout

## Dependencies

- react-day-picker
- date-fns
- Radix UI components (Popover)
- lucide-react for icons

## Future Improvements

- Add date range selection for filtering multiple days
- Implement a more advanced time picker with custom time input
- Add localization support for date/time formats
- Optimize performance for large datasets
