## Problem Statement

The original Schedule Layout implementation had several issues:

1. **Non-intuitive Controls:** The preview pane controls used ambiguous arrow symbols (←, →, D) that didn't clearly communicate their function.
2. **Data Rendering Issues:** Rich text content was displayed as raw JSON instead of properly formatted text.
3. **Infinite Loading Loop:** The ScheduleManager component was triggering repeated network requests, causing performance issues.
4. **Suboptimal UI Design:** The overall visual design lacked refinement and proper spacing.
5. **Poor Mobile Experience:** The layout didn't adapt well to mobile viewports.

## Solution Approach

The solution involved a comprehensive refactoring of the Schedule Layout components with these guiding principles:

1. **Clear Communication:** Replace ambiguous symbols with descriptive text labels and supporting icons.
2. **Proper Data Rendering:** Integrate the existing RichTextDisplay component for proper content display.
3. **Performance Optimization:** Fix dependency issues in React hooks to prevent infinite rendering loops.
4. **Visual Design Enhancements:** Improve typography, spacing, color usage, and component styling.
5. **Responsive Considerations:** Ensure the layout works across different screen sizes.

## Component Changes

### 1. SchedulePreview Component

The SchedulePreview component was completely refactored to:

- Replace arrow symbols with clear text labels ("Hide Preview", "Split View", "Full Preview")
- Add supporting icons from Lucide for better visual communication
- Properly render rich text content using the RichTextDisplay component
- Improve the table layout with alternating row colors and proper typography
- Add a clear header section with date information
- Style the download button with an appropriate icon

```tsx
// Key improvements in SchedulePreview.tsx
<div className="flex gap-xs">
  <Button 
    onClick={() => onViewStateChange("collapsed-preview")}
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    className={cn(
      "flex items-center gap-xs text-xs font-medium", 
      currentViewState === "collapsed-preview" && "bg-primary-light border-primary text-primary"
    )}
    title="Hide preview panel and show only the schedule manager"
  >
    <Minimize className="h-4 w-4" />
    <span>Hide Preview</span>
  </Button>
  {/* Split View and Full Preview buttons follow similar pattern */}
</div>

{/* Proper rich text rendering */}
<td className="p-sm border-b border-divider align-top">
  <div className="prose prose-sm max-w-none">
    <RichTextDisplay content={schedule.place} />
  </div>
</td>
```

### 2. ScheduleManager Component

The ScheduleManager component was improved to:

- Fix the infinite loading loop issue with proper useEffect dependency management
- Enhance the visual design of schedule cards
- Improve date and time formatting
- Properly render rich text content
- Add appropriate icons and visual cues

```tsx
// Key improvements in ScheduleManager.tsx

// Fix for infinite loading issue
useEffect(() => {
  const loadSchedules = async () => {
    // Implementation...
  };

  loadSchedules();
  // Only include filterDate in dependencies, not onSchedulesUpdate
}, [filterDate]);

// Visual improvements
<div className="bg-primary-light px-md py-sm border-b border-divider">
  <h2 className="text-lg font-medium text-primary">
    {formatDate(schedule.schedule_date)}
  </h2>
  <p className="text-text-secondary font-medium">
    {formatTime(schedule.time_range.start)} - {formatTime(schedule.time_range.end)}
  </p>
</div>
```

### 3. ScheduleLayout Component

The ScheduleLayout component was optimized to:

- Use React's useCallback hook to prevent function recreation and infinite loops
- Improve state management between components
- Handle responsive layout transitions more smoothly

```tsx
// Key improvements in ScheduleLayout.tsx
const handleViewStateChange = useCallback((newState: ViewState) => {
  setViewState(newState);
}, []);

const handleDateChange = useCallback((date: string | undefined) => {
  setSelectedDate(date);
}, []);

// Use useCallback to prevent recreation of this function on each render
const updateFilteredSchedules = useCallback((schedules: Schedule[]) => {
  setFilteredSchedules(schedules);
}, []);
```

## UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design Enhancements

1. **Typography Improvements:**
   - Used proper font weights (medium for headings, regular for content)
   - Added uppercase styling for column headers
   - Improved letter spacing and line height

2. **Color System:**
   - Utilized the primary color for important elements
   - Used primary-light for backgrounds to create visual hierarchy
   - Maintained consistent text colors across components

3. **Spacing & Layout:**
   - Added consistent padding and margins throughout components
   - Improved card layouts with better content organization
   - Used grid layouts for better alignment of related content

4. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Enhanced button styling with proper hover states
   - Added supporting icons to buttons for better affordance
   - Improved disabled state styling

### Accessibility Considerations

1. **Button Labels:**
   - All buttons now have clear text labels in addition to icons
   - Added title attributes for additional context on hover

2. **Color Contrast:**
   - Ensured sufficient contrast between text and background colors
   - Used proper color combinations for active and hover states

3. **Semantic HTML:**
   - Used appropriate table markup for tabular data in the preview

## Bug Fixes

### Infinite Rendering Loop

The most critical bug fixed was the infinite rendering loop in the ScheduleManager component, which was causing repeated network requests:

1. **Root Cause:**
   - The `onSchedulesUpdate` callback was included in the useEffect dependency array
   - Each time the parent component (ScheduleLayout) re-rendered, it created a new function reference
   - This new reference triggered the useEffect hook again, causing a loop

2. **Solution:**
   - Removed `onSchedulesUpdate` from the dependency array in ScheduleManager
   - Used React's useCallback in ScheduleLayout to maintain stable function references
   - Added a useRef with isInitialMount flag to optimize loading indicators

### Rich Text Rendering

Fixed the issue where rich text content was displayed as raw JSON:

1. **Root Cause:**
   - The rich text content was being rendered as JSON.stringify() output
   - The RichTextDisplay component wasn't properly integrated

2. **Solution:**
   - Properly imported and used the RichTextDisplay component
   - Wrapped the component in appropriate styling containers
   - Ensured proper handling of null or undefined content

## Implementation Details

### Technologies Used

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui components (Button, Input)
- Lucide React for icons
- Tiptap for rich text rendering

### Performance Considerations

1. **Optimized Renders:**
   - Used useCallback to memoize function references
   - Implemented isInitialMount pattern to prevent unnecessary loading states
   - Carefully managed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

2. **Code Organization:**
   - Separated formatting functions from rendering logic
   - Used consistent naming conventions throughout components
   - Added clear comments for complex logic

## Testing

The improved components were tested in various scenarios:

1. **Functional Testing:**
   - Verified the view state transitions (Hide, Split, Full)
   - Tested date filtering and schedule loading
   - Ensured rich text content displays correctly

2. **Visual Testing:**
   - Checked appearance across different viewport sizes
   - Verified styling consistency with the rest of the application
   - Tested with different amounts of content

## Future Enhancements

Several potential enhancements could further improve the Schedule Layout:

1. **PDF Generation:**
   - Implement the PDF download functionality with proper formatting
   - Add support for Bangla/Bengali text in PDFs as in the HTML implementation

2. **Drag to Resize:**
   - Add the ability to drag and resize the split between panels
   - Remember user's preferred panel sizes

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for toggling between view states
   - Implement focus management for better keyboard navigation

4. **Additional Preview Views:**
   - Week view for schedules
   - Month calendar view
   - Various PDF template options

5. **Animations:**
   - Add smoother transitions between view states
   - Implement subtle loading animations

---

By implementing these improvements, the Schedule Layout and PDF Preview components now provide a more intuitive, visually appealing, and efficient user experience that matches modern web application standards.
