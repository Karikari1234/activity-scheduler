# Logout Implementation Documentation

This document details the implementation of the logout functionality for the Activity Scheduler application, which was part of Ticket 1.2: Implement Secure Session Management.

## Overview

The logout implementation allows users to terminate their session securely, invalidating their authentication tokens and redirecting them to the login page. This functionality is essential for secure session management and completes the authentication flow.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server Action for Logout

A server action was created to handle the logout process securely on the server side.

**File: `/src/app/auth/actions.ts`**

```typescript
"use server";

import { revalidatePath } from "next/cache";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import { createClient } from "@/utils/supabase/server";

export async function signOut() {
  const supabase = await createClient();
  
  // Sign out the user (defaults to 'global' scope which terminates all sessions)
  await supabase.auth.signOut();
  
  // Revalidate all pages that use the user session
  revalidatePath("/", "layout");
  
  // Redirect to login page
  redirect("/login");
}
```

This server action performs three key operations:
1. Calls Supabase's `auth.signOut()` method to invalidate the authentication tokens
2. Revalidates the entire layout to ensure UI updates reflect the logged-out state
3. Redirects the user to the login page

### 2. Logout Button Component

A reusable logout button component was created to provide a consistent UI element for triggering the logout action.

**File: `/src/app/components/LogoutButton.tsx`**

```typescript
"use client";

import { signOut } from "../auth/actions";

export default function LogoutButton() {
  return (
    <form>
      <button 
        formAction={signOut}
        className="text-primary hover:underline font-medium"
      >
        Logout
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

This client component:
- Is marked with `"use client"` directive since it interacts with form actions
- Uses a form with `formAction` to trigger the server action
- Maintains the application's styling conventions

### 3. Layout Integration

The root layout was updated to conditionally render navigation items based on authentication status and include the logout button.

**File: `/src/app/layout.tsx`**

The layout now:
- Fetches the current user's authentication status
- Shows login/signup links for unauthenticated users
- Shows dashboard link and logout button for authenticated users

### 4. Dashboard Integration

The dashboard page was enhanced to include a logout button for user convenience.

**File: `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`**

The dashboard header now displays:
- The user's email
- A logout button for easy session termination

## Authentication Flow

The complete authentication flow now includes:

1. **Sign Up**: User creates an account → Email verification required
2. **Login**: User authenticates → Session established with secure tokens
3. **Session Management**: Tokens are automatically refreshed via middleware
4. **Logout**: User terminates session → Tokens invalidated → Redirect to login

## Security Considerations

The implementation follows security best practices by:

1. Using server actions for sensitive operations
2. Leveraging HTTP-only cookies (via Supabase's default implementation)
3. Properly invalidating tokens on logout
4. Handling session state updates across the application

## Testing

To test the logout functionality:

1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Verify you can access protected routes
3. Click the logout button in the navigation or dashboard
4. Verify you are redirected to the login page
5. Try to access a protected route (e.g., dashboard)
6. Verify you are redirected to the login page, confirming the session was terminated

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the logout functionality could include:

1. Add confirmation dialog before logout to prevent accidental clicks
2. Implement selective session termination (logout from current device only)
3. Add session tracking to show the user their active sessions
4. Implement automatic logout after a period of inactivity
