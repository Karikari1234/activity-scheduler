# Ticket 3.2: Scheduler Backend Integration and UI Feedback

**Version:** 3.2
**Feature:** Backend Integration for Meeting Scheduler
**Date:** May 7, 2025

## Overview

This documentation covers the integration of the new-scheduler page with the Supabase backend database, as well as the implementation of user feedback mechanisms and UI improvements to enhance the user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Format Conversion

- Created utility file `dataConverters.ts` to handle data transformation
- Implemented functions to convert between backend `Schedule` objects and frontend `MeetingUI` objects
- Added support for extracting plain text from rich text content
- Implemented date and time format conversion utilities

### 2. Toast Notification System

- Created a Toast component for user feedback
- Implemented a ToastContext provider for application-wide notifications
- Added toast notifications for successful CRUD operations
- Added error toasts for operation failures

### 3. UI Improvements

- Added a refresh button to manually reload data
- Implemented loading states with visual indicators
- Improved error handling and display
- Enhanced the form modal with proper validation

### 4. Backend Integration

- Updated MeetingSchedulerLayout to fetch data from Supabase via store
- Modified CRUD operations to work with the backend
- Added proper error handling for API operations
- Implemented data transformation between frontend and backend formats

### 5. Form Enhancements

- Added end time field for meetings
- Implemented auto-selection of end time based on start time
- Enhanced validation and error handling in forms
- Improved modal behavior for better UX

## Technical Details

### Data Conversion Logic

- Backend `Schedule` objects contain rich text content stored as JSONB
- Frontend needs plain text for display and rich text for backend storage
- Time format conversion between 12-hour display format and 24-hour storage format
- Date conversion between display format (May 7, 2025) and ISO format (2025-05-07)

### Toast Notification System

The system uses React context to provide application-wide toast notifications:
```
ToastProvider
└── ToastContext
    └── useToast() hook (provides showToast function)
```

Toast types include: success, error, info, and warning.

### Remaining Issues

Despite the improvements, the READ operation is still not working correctly. Data is successfully posted to the backend, but the component fails to properly read and display the data after creation. Further debugging is needed to identify the root cause.

Possible issues include:
- Data format mismatches between frontend expectations and backend responses
- Timing issues with state updates and re-rendering
- Issues with the store's fetchSchedules function

## Testing

To test this implementation:
1. Navigate to the /schedules/new-scheduler page
2. Try adding a new meeting using the form
3. Check for toast notifications confirming success
4. Use the refresh button to attempt reloading data
5. Check console logs for debugging information about the data flow

## Dependencies

- date-fns for date manipulation
- react-day-picker for calendar functionality 
- Supabase for backend storage
- React Context API for toast notification system

## Future Improvements

1. Fix the READ operation to properly display data after creation
2. Add better error handling with more specific error messages
3. Implement optimistic UI updates for smoother UX
4. Add confirmation dialogs for delete operations
5. Enhance the refresh mechanism with automatic polling
