# Ticket 1.1: Setup Basic Authentication UI & Supabase Auth Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of basic authentication in the Activity Scheduler application using Next.js 15 and Supabase Auth. The implementation includes sign-up and login functionality with proper redirection flows and server-side authentication validation.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria                                         | Status       | Implementation Details                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User can navigate to Sign Up and Log In pages    | ✅ Completed | Implemented `/signup` and `/login` routes with navigation links between them        |
| Sign Up form creates a new user in Supabase Auth | ✅ Completed | Form with server action (`signup/actions.ts`) to create user via Supabase Auth API  |
| Log In form authenticates an existing user       | ✅ Completed | Form with server action (`login/actions.ts`) using Supabase Auth signInWithPassword |
| Successful login redirects to dashboard          | ✅ Completed | Redirect to `/dashboard` after successful authentication                            |
| Basic UI elements for signup/login forms         | ✅ Completed | Simple styled forms with essential form elements                                    |

```

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign-up Process**:

   - User fills out the sign-up form with email and password
   - `signup` server action calls Supabase Auth API to create user
   - User is redirected to `/auth/verify-email`
   - Email with verification link is sent to user
   - When user clicks the link, they're directed to `/auth/confirm` which handles token verification
   - After successful verification, user is redirected to `/dashboard`

2. **Login Process**:

   - User fills out login form with email and password
   - `login` server action authenticates via Supabase Auth API
   - On successful login, user is redirected to `/dashboard`
   - On failure, user is redirected to `/error`

3. **Session Management**:

   - Sessions are maintained using cookies via the `@supabase/ssr` package
   - Middleware (`middleware.ts`) intercepts requests to update the session
   - Protected routes check for authenticated user via Supabase client

### Key Components

#### Supabase Clients

The application uses two different Supabase clients:

1. **Server Client** (`utils/supabase/server.ts`):

   - Used in server components and server actions
   - Handles cookie-based authentication

2. **Browser Client** (`utils/supabase/client.ts`):

   - Used for client-side operations
   - Maintains session state on the client

#### Route Protection

Routes are protected via:

1. **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):

   - Intercepts all requests except static assets
   - Redirects unauthenticated users to `/login` when accessing protected routes

2. **Server-side Checks**:

   - Protected pages like `/dashboard` verify auth status with `getUser()`
   - Redirects to login if no authenticated user is found

## UI Implementation

The authentication UI includes:

1. **Sign-up Page**:

   - Email and password inputs
   - Form validation for required fields
   - Link to login page for existing users

2. **Login Page**:

   - Email and password inputs
   - Form validation for required fields
   - Link to sign-up page for new users

3. **Email Verification Page**:

   - Instructions for email verification
   - Link back to login page

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 15**: App Router for routing and server components/actions
- **Supabase Auth**: Authentication backend
- **@supabase/ssr**: Server-side rendering support for Supabase
- **TypeScript**: Type safety throughout the application

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the authentication system:

1. Add password strength requirements
2. Implement social login options (Google, GitHub)
3. Add remember me functionality
4. Implement password reset flow
5. Add MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
6. Enhance error handling with more detailed user feedback
7. Improve form validation with client-side validation before submission
8. Add a loading state during form submission
9. Improve accessibility of auth forms

## Testing Notes

To test the authentication flow:

1. Navigate to `/signup` and create a new account
2. Check email for verification link
3. Click the verification link to confirm account
4. Try logging in with the created credentials
5. Verify redirect to dashboard occurs
6. Test route protection by accessing dashboard directly when logged out

## Configuration

Supabase requires the following environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: URL of your Supabase project
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Anon/public key for your Supabase project
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Base URL of your app (for email templates)
